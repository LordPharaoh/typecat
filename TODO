font.py:137:  there are more categories than just serif and sans
font.py:147:  when we get linear reps of each letter use that instead
font.py:224:  this is probably really slow and inefficient
font.py:282:  buttons are really jerky and dont' work when you click text or
font.py:329:  varying colors and randomly chosen phrases
font.py:334:  not good practice

Get distance/similarity between 2 fonts

Phonetic typing/language extraction

IMPORTANT: feature scaline when sorting
IMPORTANT: Clean up/refactor the crap that is types.py

there could be a lot of optimizations; use redis and calculate stats to find a range instead of having to do full sorts
Expand config window when adding more font dirs
