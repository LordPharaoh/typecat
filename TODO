font.py:34:   curve quantification
font.py:137:  there are more categories than just serif and sans
font.py:147:  when we get linear reps of each letter use that instead
font.py:224:  this is probably really slow and inefficient
font.py:282:  buttons are really jerky and dont' work when you click text or
font.py:329:  varying colors and randomly chosen phrases
font.py:334:  not good practice
Do centroid metrics with erode/dilate, the current method is pretty meh
Get distance/similarity between 2 fonts
Add a scrollbar
Phonetic typing/language extraction
IMPORTANT: ITALICS ARE RECOGNIZED AS SERIF
Recognize when fonts can't be rendered in PIL or are rendered as boxes and skip those
there could be a lot of optimizations; use redis and calculate stats to find a range instead of having to do full sorts
go over with pylint
font metadata and 'About' text

Expand config window when adding more font dirs
