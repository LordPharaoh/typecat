# Types Font Palette
![Types Demo](types-demo.gif)
Types is a font 'palette' that allows you to search for fonts and filter them based on other features including:
* width
* height
* aspect ratio
* thickness
* thickness variation
* category
* *curvature* TODO
## Dependencies
* python3
* pillow
* numpy
## Current status
Types currently functions as a basic, font-searching manager. The data necessary to filter by other features is collected, but an interface to find fonts based on their features has not yet been implemented.
