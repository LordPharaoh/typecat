# Typecat

Typecat allows you to search and filter fonts based on visual features including
* width
* height
* aspect ratio
* thickness
* thickness variation
* category *almost*
* similarity *almost*
## Dependencies
Most python dependencies will be auto-installed by pip. This is what you need to obtain on your own:
* python3
* GTK3
* PyGObject Introspection
## Installation
Once the dependencies have been installed, navigate to the typecat github directory and run `pip3 install .` (you may need root/admin privileges).
You can now run it by running `python3 -m typecat`.
## Status
While it is currently fully functioning, there remains to be a lot of room for improvement.

* Better feature spreading
* Categorization (That's happening like, right now)
* Feature/font similarity
* Font pairings
* Config/reload window
